* Versioning Files

Documentation for Git can be installed into Emacs, by installing the ~gitman~
info manual.  First, make sure you don't already have it available by doing ???.

Git’s manpages can be exported as an info manual called gitman. Magit’s own
info manual links to nodes in that manual instead of the actual manpages
because Info doesn’t support linking to manpages.

(setq magit-view-git-manual-method 'man)

Git Annex works only through SSH, whereas Git LFS works both with SSH and
HTTPS (SSH support was added in GitLab 8.12). Annex files are stored in a
sub-directory of the normal repositories, whereas LFS files are stored outside
of the repositories in a place you can define.
