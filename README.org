This ia my Emacs configuration, expressed in a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate]] document form so I can
explain how and why I did each configuration setting.  Since Emacs v29.1 came
out, I've reworked everything to load Emacs packages using =use-package, for a
more reproducible configuration.

Inside the content/config.org file I explain much more.

My =~/.emacs.d/init.el= is a very minimal file, with most configuration
in the =~/.emacs.d/config.org= file.
