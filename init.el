;; init.el --- Main Configuration File -*- lexical-binding: t; no-byte-compile: t -*-

;; Author: Jeffrey Rush
;; Keywords: Emacs configuration

;;; Commentary:

;; My Initialization Flow:
;;   1. early-init.el
;;   2. init.el
;;   3. config.org

;; After `early-init.el` completes its work, this file does the job of
;; setting many somewhat obscure Emacs settings and frame/window
;; settings, bootstrapping `straight.el` from the Internet and
;; declaring which package repos that `straight.el` should pull from.
;;
;; It then finishes by loading further configuration from a collection
;; of emacs-lisp source blocks tangled from config.org.  Using
;; config.org makes it easier for me to document my settings,
;; providing explanations and links to further learning material.

;; Emacs 30.1+ configuration.  (my version of Emacs at the time of composing this file)

;;; Code:

;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Set various somewhat obscure Emacs variables, for efficient operation.

(setq

  ;; I have some larger files and I don't want Emacs to complain about
  ;; them so I raised the threshold from 9MB.

  large-file-warning-threshold  20000000 ; 20MB

  ;; Prevent stale byte-code issues in scripts, while saving startup
  ;; I/O checks.  Especially relevant when not byte-compiling
  ;; everything, to prioritize non-byte-compiled source files to
  ;; prevent the use of stale byte-code.

  load-prefer-newer  'noninteractive

  ;; Maximum number of bytes to read from subprocess in a single chunk.
  ;;
  ;; Enlarge the value only if the subprocess generates very large
  ;; (megabytes) amounts of data in one go.  Improves LSP and
  ;; subprocess throughput.  Critical for lsp-mode, eglot, etc.

  read-process-output-max  (* 1024 1024 4) ; 4 MB

  ;; Do NOT compact (discard) cached fonts during garbage collection.
  ;;
  ;; Prevents GC-triggered font redisplay stutter with large fonts.
  ;; Very useful for multilingual documents or UI-heavy configs.

  ;; Some large fonts cause lots of consing and trigger GC.  If they
  ;; are discarded from the font caches during garbage collection,
  ;; they will need to be opened AGAIN during redisplay, which slows
  ;; down redisplay.
  ;;
  ;; If you see font-related delays in displaying some special
  ;; characters, and cannot switch to a smaller font for those
  ;; characters, set this variable non-nil.  Disabling compaction of
  ;; font caches might enlarge the Emacs memory footprint in sessions
  ;; that use lots of different fonts.

  inhibit-compacting-font-caches  t

  ;; Maximum number of lines to keep in the *Messages* log buffer.
  ;; Good practice that prevents runaway *Messages* buffer size while
  ;; still allowing debugging.

  message-log-max  16384

  ;; This disables loading of `site-start.el`, which some distros (like
  ;; Debian, Arch, etc.) use to inject site-wide behavior into all
  ;; Emacs sessions.  Use it in personal configs aiming for
  ;; reproducibility.

;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Set various low-level UI presentation variables for maximum performance.

(setq

  ;; Prevents rounding errors during font/frame changes. Very useful.

  frame-resize-pixelwise  t

  ;; Resizing the Emacs frame can be a terribly expensive part of
  ;; changing the font.  By inhibiting this, we easily halve startup
  ;; times with fonts that are larger than the system default.
  ;;
  ;; Avoids expensive frame resizing during font/theme init. Good for
  ;; large fonts or tiling WMs (which I use under Pop_OS! by
  ;; System76).

  frame-inhibit-implied-resize  t

  ;; Prevents the message that says: "Welcome to GNU Emacs, one
  ;; component of the GNU operating system." that normally appears at
  ;; the top of the *scratch* buffer.

(setq-default

  ;; Avoid flicker or incorrect sizing of child frames
  ;; (e.g. completion popups) under GTK.  `resize-mode` ensures GTK
  ;; resizes them correctly without delays.  Especially helpful in
  ;; Wayland, where native resizing behavior differs from X11 and is
  ;; stricter.  It's a no-regret setting under GTK/Wayland.

  x-gtk-resize-child-frames  'resize-mode

  ;; Control which symbols appear in the left and right fringes of
  ;; Emacs windows to indicate things like:
  ;;
  ;;  - Buffer truncation
  ;;  - Continuation lines (soft-wrapped)
  ;;  - Buffer boundaries
  ;;  - Overlay arrows (e.g. for next-error)
  ;;  - Custom indicators (e.g. for git-gutter, flycheck, etc.)

  ;; fringe-indicator-alist  (assq-delete-all 'truncation fringe-indicator-alist)
)

;; Highly recommended under Wayland/PGTK.  Disables reading X resources
;; (e.g., .Xresources), which are irrelevant and possibly harmful
;; under Wayland.  Prevents color/font overrides that conflict with your
;; Emacs config.  Also disables xrdb-related hacks from old X11 setups.
