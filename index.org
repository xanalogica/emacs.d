* Introduction   BLAH BLAH BLAH

This is my Emacs configuration, expressed in the [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode markup]] so I can
explain how and why I did each configuration setting, and yet automatically
export it into emacs-lisp format for loading into Emacs at start-up time.
This style of documenting is called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][Literate Programming]].

I maintain my Emacs configuration https://github.com/xanalogica/.emacs.d/ and
automatically publish the polished documentation at ??? using a CI pipeline.
